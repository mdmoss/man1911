h1. Arguments

When someone runs your program, they can give it arguments on the command line.

{% highlight sh %}

# In this case, the program "prog" is given three arguments "one", "two", and "three"
./prog one two three

{% endhighlight %}
<br />

Each program you write has a main function. This function takes two arguments, @int argc@ and *char @argv[]@. These are how you can access the arguments given to your program. Remember, your program always gets its own name as the first argument.

{% highlight c %}

int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
    /*
     * In this case, argc is equal to 4.
     * argv is an array of strings. {"./prog", "one", "two", "three"}
     */
...

{% endhighlight %}
<br />

You can use these arguments as strings. If you want them as integers or floats, the @atoi@ and @atof@ functions make your life easy.
Remember to check argc, to make sure your program was actually given arguments.

{% highlight sh %}

./prog 54321

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}

int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc == 2) {
        int number = atoi(argv[1]);
        /* Number now equals 54321 */
    }

{% endhighlight %}

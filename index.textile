h1. student@pc:~$ man 1911

_The hard part is over_. If you've paid attention through the semester, gone to most of your lectures and shown up to a few tutes, you've hopefully got a decent idea of what's going on. Even if you don't feel like it, just by making it this far you've absorbed some thinking on how computers work and how we can make them do things for us (because we're lazy, right?).

All that's left is a bit of practice at getting your instructions into a form that the computer can understand. The more you do it, the easier it gets.
